/**
 * @name parse
 * @category Common Helpers
 * @summary Parse the date.
 *
 * @description
 * Return the date parsed from string using the given format string.
 *
 * > ⚠️ Please note that the `format` tokens differ from Moment.js and other libraries.
 * > See: https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/unicodeTokens.md
 *
 * The characters in the format string wrapped between two single quotes characters (') are escaped.
 * Two single quotes in a row, whether inside or outside a quoted sequence, represent a 'real' single quote.
 *
 * Format of the format string is based on Unicode Technical Standard #35:
 * https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Date_Field_Symbol_Table
 * with a few additions (see note 5 below the table).
 *
 * Not all tokens are compatible. Combinations that don't make sense or could lead to bugs are prohibited
 * and will throw `RangeError`. For example usage of 24-hour format token with AM/PM token will throw an exception:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * parse('23 AM', 'HH a', new Date())
 * //=> RangeError: The format string mustn't contain `HH` and `a` at the same time
 * ```
 *
 * See the compatibility table: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQOPU3xUhplll6dyoMmVUXHKl_8CRDs6_ueLmex3SoqwhuolkuN3O05l4rqx5h1dKX8eb46Ul-CCSrq/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true

 * Notes:
 * 1. "Formatting" units (e.g. formatting quarter) in the default en-US locale
 *    are the same as "stand-alone" units, but are different in some languages.
 *    "Formatting" units are declined according to the rules of the language
 *    in the context of a date. "Stand-alone" units are always nominative singular.
 *    In `format` function, they will produce different result:
 *
 *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do LLLL', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopad'`
 *
 *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do MMMM', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopadu'`
 *
 *    `parse` will try to match both formatting and stand-alone units interchangeably.
 *
 * 2. Any sequence of the identical letters is a pattern, unless it is escaped by
 *    the single quote characters (see below).
 *    If the sequence is longer than listed in table:
 *    - for numerical units (`yyyyyyyy`) `parse` will try to match a number
 *      as wide as the sequence
 *    - for text units (`MMMMMMMM`) `parse` will try to match the widest variation of the unit.
 *      These variations are marked with "2" in the last column of the table.
 *
 * 3. `QQQQQ` and `qqqqq` could be not strictly numerical in some locales.
 *    These tokens represent the shortest form of the quarter.
 *
 * 4. The main difference between `y` and `u` patterns are B.C. years:
 *
 *    | Year | `y` | `u` |
 *    |------|-----|-----|
 *    | AC 1 |   1 |   1 |
 *    | BC 1 |   1 |   0 |
 *    | BC 2 |   2 |  -1 |
 *
 *    Also `yy` will try to guess the century of two digit year by proximity with `referenceDate`:
 *
 *    `parse('50', 'yy', new Date(2018, 0, 1)) //=> Sat Jan 01 2050 00:00:00`
 *
 *    `parse('75', 'yy', new Date(2018, 0, 1)) //=> Wed Jan 01 1975 00:00:00`
 *
 *    while `uu` will just assign the year as is:
 *
 *    `parse('50', 'uu', new Date(2018, 0, 1)) //=> Sat Jan 01 0050 00:00:00`
 *
 *    `parse('75', 'uu', new Date(2018, 0, 1)) //=> Tue Jan 01 0075 00:00:00`
 *
 *    The same difference is true for local and ISO week-numbering years (`Y` and `R`),
 *    except local week-numbering years are dependent on `options.weekStartsOn`
 *    and `options.firstWeekContainsDate` (compare [setISOWeekYear](https://date-fns.org/docs/setISOWeekYear)
 *    and [setWeekYear](https://date-fns.org/docs/setWeekYear)).
 *
 * 5. These patterns are not in the Unicode Technical Standard #35:
 *    - `i`: ISO day of week
 *    - `I`: ISO week of year
 *    - `R`: ISO week-numbering year
 *    - `o`: ordinal number modifier
 *    - `P`: long localized date
 *    - `p`: long localized time
 *
 * 6. `YY` and `YYYY` tokens represent week-numbering years but they are often confused with years.
 *    You should enable `options.useAdditionalWeekYearTokens` to use them. See: https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/unicodeTokens.md
 *
 * 7. `D` and `DD` tokens represent days of the year but they are often confused with days of the month.
 *    You should enable `options.useAdditionalDayOfYearTokens` to use them. See: https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/unicodeTokens.md
 *
 * 8. `P+` tokens do not have a defined priority since they are merely aliases to other tokens based
 *    on the given locale.
 *
 *    using `en-US` locale: `P` => `MM/dd/yyyy`
 *    using `en-US` locale: `p` => `hh:mm a`
 *    using `pt-BR` locale: `P` => `dd/MM/yyyy`
 *    using `pt-BR` locale: `p` => `HH:mm`
 *
 * Values will be assigned to the date in the descending order of its unit's priority.
 * Units of an equal priority overwrite each other in the order of appearance.
 *
 * If no values of higher priority are parsed (e.g. when parsing string 'January 1st' without a year),
 * the values will be taken from 3rd argument `referenceDate` which works as a context of parsing.
 *
 * `referenceDate` must be passed for correct work of the function.
 * If you're not sure which `referenceDate` to supply, create a new instance of Date:
 * `parse('02/11/2014', 'MM/dd/yyyy', new Date())`
 * In this case parsing will be done in the context of the current date.
 * If `referenceDate` is `Invalid Date` or a value not convertible to valid `Date`,
 * then `Invalid Date` will be returned.
 *
 * The result may vary by locale.
 *
 * If `formatString` matches with `dateString` but does not provides tokens, `referenceDate` will be returned.
 *
 * If parsing failed, `Invalid Date` will be returned.
 * Invalid Date is a Date, whose time value is NaN.
 * Time value of Date: http://es5.github.io/#x15.9.1.1
 *
 * @typeParam DateType - The `Date` type, the function operates on. Gets inferred from passed arguments. Allows to use extensions like [`UTCDate`](https://github.com/date-fns/utc).
 * @typeParam ResultDate - The result `Date` type, it is the type returned from the context function if it is passed, or inferred from the arguments.
 *
 * @param dateStr - The string to parse
 * @param formatStr - The string of tokens
 * @param referenceDate - defines values missing from the parsed dateString
 * @param options - An object with options.
 *   see: https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/unicodeTokens.md
 *   see: https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/unicodeTokens.md
 *
 * @returns The parsed date
 *
 * @throws `options.locale` must contain `match` property
 * @throws use `yyyy` instead of `YYYY` for formatting years using [format provided] to the input [input provided]; see: https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/unicodeTokens.md
 * @throws use `yy` instead of `YY` for formatting years using [format provided] to the input [input provided]; see: https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/unicodeTokens.md

 * @throws use `dd` instead of `DD` for formatting days of the month using [format provided] to the input [input provided]; see: https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/unicodeTokens.md
 * @throws format string contains an unescaped latin alphabet character
 *
 * @example
 * // Parse 11 February 2014 from middle-endian format:
 * var result = parse('02/11/2014', 'MM/dd/yyyy', new Date())

 * - `i` is ISO day of week. For `i` and `ii` is returns numeric ISO week days,
 *   i.e. 7 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, etc.
 * - `I` is ISO week of year, as opposed to `w` which is local week of year.
 * - `R` is ISO week-numbering year, as opposed to `Y` which is local week-numbering year.
 *   `R` is supposed to be used in conjunction with `I` and `i`
 *   for universal ISO week-numbering date, whereas
 *   `Y` is supposed to be used in conjunction with `w` and `e`
 *   for week-numbering date specific to the locale.

/**
 * @name parseISO
 * @category Common Helpers
 * @summary Parse ISO string
 *
 * @description
 * Parse the given string in ISO 8601 format and return an instance of Date.
 *
 * Function accepts complete ISO 8601 formats as well as partial implementations.
 * ISO 8601: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601
 *
 * If the argument isn't a string, the function cannot parse the string or
 * the values are invalid, it returns Invalid Date.
 *
 * @typeParam DateType - The `Date` type, the function operates on. Gets inferred from passed arguments. Allows to use extensions like [`UTCDate`](https://github.com/date-fns/utc).
 * @typeParam ResultDate - The result `Date` type, it is the type returned from the context function if it is passed, or inferred from the arguments.
 *
 * @param argument - The value to convert
 * @param options - An object with options
 *
 * @returns The parsed date in the local time zone
 *
 * @example
 * // Convert string '2014-02-11T11:30:30' to date:
 * const result = parseISO('2014-02-11T11:30:30')
 * //=> Tue Feb 11 2014 11:30:30
 *
 * @example
 * // Convert string '+02014101' to date,
 * // if the additional number of digits in the extended year format is 1:
 * const result = parseISO('+02014101', { additionalDigits: 1 })
 * //=> Fri Apr 11 2014 00:00:00

 * Converts a complete ISO date string in UTC time, the typical format for transmitting
 * a date in JSON, to a JavaScript `Date` instance.
 *
 * This is a minimal implementation for converting dates retrieved from a JSON API to
 * a `Date` instance which can be used with other functions in the `date-fns` library.
 * The following formats are supported:
 *
 * - `2000-03-15T05:20:10.123Z`: The output of `.toISOString()` and `JSON.stringify(new Date())`
 * - `2000-03-15T05:20:10Z`: Without milliseconds
 * - `2000-03-15T05:20:10+00:00`: With a zero offset, the default JSON encoded format in some other languages
 * - `2000-03-15T05:20:10+05:45`: With a positive or negative offset, the default JSON encoded format in some other languages
 * - `2000-03-15T05:20:10+0000`: With a zero offset without a colon
 * - `2000-03-15T05:20:10`: Without a trailing 'Z' symbol
 * - `2000-03-15T05:20:10.1234567`: Up to 7 digits in milliseconds field. Only first 3 are taken into account since JS does not allow fractional milliseconds
 * - `2000-03-15 05:20:10`: With a space instead of a 'T' separator for APIs returning a SQL date without reformatting
 *
 * For convenience and ease of use these other input types are also supported
 * via [toDate](https://date-fns.org/docs/toDate):
 *
 * - A `Date` instance will be cloned
 * - A `number` will be treated as a timestamp
 *
 * Any other input type or invalid date strings will return an `Invalid Date`.
 *
 * @typeParam ResultDate - The result `Date` type, it is the type returned from the context function if it is passed, or inferred from the arguments.
